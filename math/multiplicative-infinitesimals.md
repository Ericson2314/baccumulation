# Multiplicative infinitesimals?

This goes with [Multiplicative Calculus](./multiplicative-calculus.md), but where as that is mostly summarizing others work, this is original as far as I know, and so I split it out.

This would be nice for informal multiplicative differential equations, other applied tasks.

I am not sure but above I talked about "multiplicative perturbations".
We also concluded with pointing out the $d\ln x$ in the Wikipedia article.
If the $d$ "makes the expression very close to 0"; with the logarithm, that would make the $x$ close to 1.
let's say that $q$ "makes the expression very close to 1", makes a multiplicative infinitesimal.
Then we have the following things:

- Two identities:
  ```math
  d \ln x = \ln q x
  ```
  ```math
  \exp(d x) = q \exp(x)
  ```

- Elasticity a new way:
  ```math
  \epsilon = \frac {d \ln y} {d \ln x} = \frac {\ln q y} {\ln q x} = \log_{q x} {q y}
  ```

- The multiplicative derivative is:
  ```math
  \sqrt[d x] {q y}
  ```

Food for thought!
